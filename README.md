# UFOs

## Overview of Project:

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we will add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results: 

On the old webpage we would be filter Date criteria after manually clicking filter data. In the new website we can now filter Date as well as multiple other criteria automatically after typing in the data.

## Summary: 
A drawback of this design is that it does not account for typos. When further developing the website, we could add a dropdown key to help assist with mistyping. We could also add No results found if no information on the data was found.
